<h3>Time Machine (2002)</h3>
<p>A movie based on H.G. Wells' novel. I's a science fiction story about a physicist that loses his wife, so he builds a time machine to try to save her.</p>
<h3>Back to the Future (1985)</h3>
<p>Another sci-fi movie about time travelling. It really doesn't need any introduction.</p>
<h3>The Joker (2019)</h3>
<p>I went 4 times to the theater to see it.</p>
